                <p style="color:white">Hello. My username is Macintoshing, I also go by Mac, Cathode, or Easfrq online.<br>I am 14 years old and live in Stark County Ohio. (Whats ohio?)<br>I have always been fascinated by technology and how they work, I never had the best computer equipment<br> so it was a prime oportuniy to tinker with it and see what I can do to make it run better.<br> I have piles of laptops that are in good or.. questionable conditions. There current purpose is either testing Linux distrobutions<br>or running FTP file servers, maybe the ocassional minecraft server.<br><br></p>
